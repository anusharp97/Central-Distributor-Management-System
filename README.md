KLETech/SoCSE(2017-18) - 15ECSC208 Database Management System Course Project

# Problem Statement:
We came across a problem that the central distributor has a huge
collection of customer and supplier data which they were managing in
ledgers. They did not have any computerized system for now. A lot of time is
consumed during the process of business activity. So we came up with the
idea of providing them a computerized system to improve the efficiency and
performance of their daily business activity.
